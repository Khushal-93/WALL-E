## 🔍 Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to nearby objects and sends data to the Arduino. When an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, Arduino processes the data and decides the safest direction by controlling the motors through the motor driver. This process repeats continuously to ensure smooth and safe autonomous navigation.
